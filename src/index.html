      <h4>You never knew a bucket could do this!</h4></br>
  
      <p>With our new-fangled line of all-you-can-smash buckets delivered right to your doorstep every night for a month twice a decade, you'll never run out of suspicious bucketry ever again!</p>

      <p>One of our most famous Bucketloads<sup>&copy;</sup> carried the weight of the entire Antarctican volunteer moose–militia in one adorable airport carry-on-sized package. Of the seven thousand subscribers who received one of these buckets, literally none of them hand-wrote us a college-ruled complaint letter! Could you every truly forgive yourself for missing out on an opportunity like that?</p>

      <p>Another famous bucket included a steaming goop of unidentifiable slop! Throw it at your friends or eat it and hope for the best&mdash;the possibilities are figuratively limitless! If only you'd been around for that one, huh?</p>

      <p>Perhaps our worst choice was that time we decided to fill a few thousand unmarked buckets with very pointy, poisonous glass-hewn shivs, handmade from the scraggles of the Fluggly Marshbuffoon. That was quite the lawsuit, believe you me! Nevertheless, great publicity…</p>
